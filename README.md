# reseau-de-neurons-Vivado-
CNN LeNet-5 implementation for Zynq FPGA Development Board.

The source code to realize the neural network is located at: neural.sdk/reseau_neuron/LED_test_tut_1C.c

The name of the source code file should be corrected and commented accordingly, but is unlikely to happen in the near future...
